App Topic: Weather

Introduction:
Weather Buddies is a simple and user-friendly mobile weather application designed to help users quickly check real-time weather conditions and forecasts. Beyond weather updates, the app aims to support social interaction by allowing users to create group chats and share live weather experiences with friends.

Motivation / Objective:
The objective of Weather Buddies is to make weather checking more engaging and social. Instead of only relying on generic forecasts, users can share real-time conditions (e.g., sudden rain, strong wind, haze) within their friend groups. This creates a fun, community-based way of staying informed and planning outdoor activities.

Usage of ChatGPT, Gemini LLMs for assistance.
